## FAQ

### What does Mimey mean?

[Mimey][mimey] is one of my favorite characters from the
[Pokémon TV Series][pokemon-tv-series] and using the name of a
[Mr. Mime][mr-mime] seems appropiate for an emulator (specially for a Game Boy
one).

### What games does it run?

None at the moment.

### When will I be able to run games?

This is a side project, so I don't know.

### Your emulator sucks! Where can I find a decent one?

Mimey is a work in progress. In the meantime [let me help you find
one][emulators].

### Why do you want to build yet another Game Boy emulator?

One of my dreams since I first used an emulator was to create one by myself, I
enjoy programming and I think this will be a great learning experience. My goal
is being able to run [Pokémon Red and Blue][red-blue].

* [Satoshi Tariji](satoshi-tariji) for creating Pokémon.
* [Episode 64 of the Pokémon TV Series][episode-64] for making me like Mr.
  Mime. Before that episode I really hated Mr. Mime (who
  can hate that Pokémon? I can't remember why I hated it).
* The great tutorial of [Imran Nazar][imran-nazar] finally gave me the
  motivation to start writing this emulator.
